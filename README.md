### Model

To Create your very own 3d avatar there are few steps that you will have to do, a bit complicated but once you done with the steps, it will look just awesome.

- Step 1 : Go to <a href="http://readyplayer.me/" >Ready Player</a> and Registered to there website.
- Step 2 : Once given the access , create a full body avatar, they will guide you how to create it with the webcam.
- Step 3 : Have your model downloaded, which can be downloaded from Home Page, left side of Customize Look.
- Step 4 : Have Blender Downloaded ðŸ˜‚
- Step 5 : <a href="http://readyplayer.me/" >Watch This video</a> to attach the animation to your model. and in the end export it as GLB file.
- Step 6 : Once you have model.glb file ready, Drag it in to public folder and replace it with existing one and from the terminal `cd public && npx gltfjsx model.glb`
- Step 7 : That will create a model.js file for you, drag it to components/avatar, before you do that make sure you copy this code

```
  const group = useRef();
  const { nodes, materials, animations } = useGLTF("/model.glb");
  const { actions } = useAnimations(animations, group);
  useEffect(() => {
  materials.castShadow = true;
  materials.receiveShadow = true;
  if (materials?.material?.map) materials.material.map.anisotropy = 16;
  actions["idle.001"]?.play();
  }, []);

```

In the model.js file, look at the existing one to understand what is happening, basically we are triggering animation to play on mount.

Or

Just hide the model by going into `Page/Home` and with in Home Object, look for the property `showModel` and set it false.
